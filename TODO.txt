ALWAYS: Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit

START UP:

- organize forking plan
	- general renaming scheme/plan
	- what parts/files should be standardized?
		- 

- set up heroku to run
	- services (sql/redis) passwords, environment variables
	- app boot (procfile, heroku setting)
	- verify that we don't have any fighting with jiken due to cloned names
	- fix config file

- mysql local login check
	- clone the jiken DB as a starting point for testing purposes

- set up git for pushes to heroku/GH
	- attempt first push/run, login to site, ensure that the DBs are functioning


- anaconda environment clone

SWITCH UP:

DB:
	- rewrite the models
	- overwrite the sql
	- rework/factor broken python code/view

Front end:
	- Go through each page and rewrite
	? change colour scheme?
	- fix all references to correct for DB changes
 	- redo card layout
	- redo all images
	- rename EnTest? (probably worth it for findability)
	- redo the readme for github
