- Add alpha test warning, talk about word ordering 'logo' vs 'churl'
- redo history
- check all social media links
- css fixes
	- long words don't fit
	- image not quite centered
	- hide help button for now
	- retest on multiple resolutions
- remove the white BG from the icon?
- fix the log overrun problem
- look for dictionaries that have apis
- do more tests, push l2r
- think more about resetting default ordering (10k will take a while to reshuffle correctly otherwise)

MAIN

Tweaking:    
    - rework the magic numbers involved in estimating a,t (t especially)
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
    - fix the words multiplier (10k .... ~5x?)
    
DB:
    ? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
        - use 2~3 dictionaries as needed
        - show multiple or just one
        - multiple languages/setting? (german, japanese definitions?)
        - can i pull definitions and not store them myself? (could allow many more definitions, save SQL space)
    - need to handle logging questions better
        - currently could overrun the 10k limit and crash server...
        - why ever log more than 500?
        - drop id?
        
Front end:
	- new 'help' button images
    	- FAQ style?
    	
Bugs:
    - forcemetaupdate throwing a timeout with no msgs... randomly twice, then it worked fine. (was cpu sleeping?)
    
Misc:
	- redo the readme for github
	- beta testing
	- enable the keep alive
    
CORE/BOTH:
    - enable autopushing l2r w/ the meta updates
    - update packages/python, trim reqs
    - identify magic numbers w/ inline comments
    - move scheduler times into config
    - flesh out an admin page
        - add a shutdown fn (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 1, force update)
        - flush/reset redis
    
Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
    - go through git log to find changes to push across

LATER
+++++++++++

- reduce step size for l2r
- set test timeout back to 1hr

MAYBE

? log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
? change colour scheme? Dark mode?
? merger of all testing thingies? Select a from and to (kanji->english, eng->eng) .... some losses from going generic, easier to maintain, harder to build... vocab only?
