- fix the log overrun problem
- rework the magic numbers involved in estimating a,t (t especially)
    - tend towards the average t for longer (use average t instead of magic #)
- switch to wiktionary! It also has multilanguage support!
    - re-examine ripping data from it.... but it looks very hard to support fully.
        
- hp
    - works best for users that know 1~20k words
    - add some more seo to the description
    - write about caveats for 'what is a word' (compounds, stems, conjugations), how accurate it will be, and my 10k sample
    - links to jiken!

Tweaking:    
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
    - when question goes oob, try 5x for a new random question before defaulting to the one at the end
    
DB:       
    - need to handle logging questions better
        - currently could overrun the 10k limit and crash server...
        - why ever log more than 500?
        - drop id?
    - add binary columns for word's inclusion in various groups (toefl,oxford 3000, etc)
    
Front end:
    - links to multiple dictionaries!
	- new 'help' button images
    	- FAQ style? On home page?
    	- reenable button
    - History
        - add toefl, grade level estimates, categories? (like 'medical','archaic')
        
Bugs:
    - the scaler isn't multiplying correctly, it looks like it is getting clipped/rounded and then multiplied so its all x5.0
    - test_log should ideally store num_known as well instead of just using 'a' which isn't quite accurate for comparisons
    - words at extremes aren't reshuffling w/ l2r (like entest)
    - forcemetaupdate throwing a timeout with no error msgs... randomly twice, then it worked fine. (was cpu sleeping?)

Misc:
	- redo the readme for github
	- beta testing
	
CORE/BOTH:
    - update packages/python, trim reqs
    - identify magic numbers w/ inline comments
    - move scheduler times into config
    - flesh out an admin page
        - add a shutdown fn (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 1, force update)
        - flush/reset redis
    - show histogram of historical user scores and place user on it
    
Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
    - go through git log to find changes to push across

LATER
+++++++++++
- reduce step size for l2r
- set test timeout back to 1hr
- in /test it should show latest nodes
- push stuff back to jiken

MAYBE

- export list to anki
? change to a left side, rightside algorithm to fit, rather than sigmoid
- make 'more...' a framed popup to avoid leaving site/test
- show user other tests from same ip. links, graph
? better message for attempting to continue a timed out test? (rarely comes up)
? log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
? change colour scheme? Dark mode?
? merger of all testing thingies? Select a from and to (kanji->english, eng->eng) .... some losses from going generic, easier to maintain, harder to build... vocab only?
? switch to dictionary api? (free is normally 100s/hr which is like 1~2 users only lol)
    https://medium.com/@martin.breuss/finding-a-useful-dictionary-api-52084a01503d
? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
    - https://dictionaryapi.com/ allows 1k/day, wordnik.com allows 100/hr ... enough to rebuild DB, but not grab live (check permissions)

    - use a 'learner's dictionary' for 5000 basic words
    - manually rewrite the easiest 100.
    - multiple languages/setting? (german, japanese definitions?) (E-J test ...)
