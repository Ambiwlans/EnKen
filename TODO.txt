Tweaking:
    - recalculate values for L2R config
    - rework the formulae around starting/default-t .... tends to be way too steep, need to quarter the assumed steepness (the min t vals seem fine though)
        - better still, use fewer magic numbers here....
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
    - fix the words multiplier (10k .... 5x?)
    
DB:
    ? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
        - use 2~3 dictionaries as needed
    - need to handle logging questions better
        - currently could overrun the 10k limit and crash server...
        - why ever log more than 500?
        - drop id?
        - log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
        
Front end:
	- new help images
	- check all social media links
	- css fixes
    	- long words don't fit
    - 'more..' should open in new tab
	History
    	- redo entirely
    	
Bug:
    - def_a set twice... and nulls in DB ... the metastats data is never actually being saved, lol...
        avg_known = int(db.session.query(func.avg(TestLog.a)).filter(TestLog.num_answered > 10)[0][0])
        current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].set('avg_known', avg_known)
        db.session.query(MetaStatistics).first().default_a = avg_known
        avg_answered = int(db.session.query(func.avg(TestLog.num_answered)).filter(TestLog.num_answered > 10)[0][0])
        current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].set('avg_answered', avg_answered)
        db.session.query(MetaStatistics).first().default_a = avg_answered

Misc:
	- redo the readme for github
	- beta testing
	- enable the keep alive
    
CORE/BOTH:
    - enable autopushing l2r w/ the meta updates
    - update packages/python
    - identify magic numbers w/ inline comments
    - add a shutdown fn (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 1, force update)
    
Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
    - go through git log to find changes to push across
