- remove frontpage references to dead variables

- set up heroku to run
	- services (sql/redis) passwords, environment variables
	- app boot (procfile, heroku setting)
	- fix config file
    - ensure there isn't conflicts with jiken
    
- push starting data to sql

Checks:
    - site connecting to dbs
    - site loads
    - recompile from push

MAIN

Config:
    - recalculate values for L2R config
    - verify that it is ok to set graph max above the number max (allowing 10k)
    
DB:
    ? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
    - need to handle logging questions better
        - currently could overrun the 10k limit and crash server...
        - why ever log more than 500?
        - drop id?
        - log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
        
Python:
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
        
Front end:
	- plan new layout (paper)
	- Go through each page and rewrite
	- fix all references to correct for DB changes
	- redo all images
	
Bug:
    
    - def_a set twice...
        avg_known = int(db.session.query(func.avg(TestLog.a)).filter(TestLog.num_answered > 10)[0][0])
        current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].set('avg_known', avg_known)
        db.session.query(MetaStatistics).first().default_a = avg_known
        avg_answered = int(db.session.query(func.avg(TestLog.num_answered)).filter(TestLog.num_answered > 10)[0][0])
        current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].set('avg_answered', avg_answered)
        db.session.query(MetaStatistics).first().default_a = avg_answered

Misc:
	- redo the readme for github
	- beta testing
        
Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
    - standardize forking
    - go through git log to find changes to push across
