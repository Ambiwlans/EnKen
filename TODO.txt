- new dictionary merger
    ? change tags to bitflags (is this better in mysql anyways?)
    ? merge defns into 1 field?
    ? paste in defns over 'alt of'....
    - add toefl, grade level, oxford 3000 fields
    ? tag system?
    - need to keep under 5MB limit
- History
    - add toefl, grade level estimates, categories? (like 'medical','archaic')       
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
        ? switch to #permil ... estimate using every 10th entry
- when question goes oob, try 5x for a new random question before defaulting to the one at the end

MAIN
+++++++++++

Tweaking:    
    - range prediction should change more based on # asked
    
DB:
    
Front end:
    - links to multiple dictionaries!
	- new 'help' button images
    	- reenable button
    ? report definition button
        - popup that allows user to reccomend a definition
        - puts the text into a log (word id + suggestion) i can check manually later
        
History:
    - missed list
        - show definitions, data on expansion of missed questions
        - 'next' button to pop in more questions
        - filter by w/e
    
    
Bugs:
    - the scaler isn't multiplying correctly, it looks like it is getting clipped/rounded and then multiplied so its all x5.0
    - test_log should ideally store num_known as well instead of just using 'a' which isn't quite accurate for comparisons
    - words at extremes aren't reshuffling w/ l2r (like entest)
    - forcemetaupdate throwing a timeout with no error msgs... randomly twice, then it worked fine. (was cpu sleeping?)

Misc:
	- redo the readme for github
	- beta testing
	
CORE/BOTH:
    - DRILL PAGE/FEATURE
    - update packages/python, trim reqs
    - identify magic numbers w/ inline comments
    - move scheduler times into config
    - flesh out an admin page
        - add a shutdown fn (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 1, force update)
        - flush/reset redis
    - show histogram of historical user scores and place user on it

Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
    - go through git log to find changes to push across
    
+++++++++++
LATER
+++++++++++
- reduce step size for l2r
- set test timeout back to 1hr
- in /test it should show latest nodes
- push stuff back to jiken
- hand edit more words

- give json trimming another go from wiki
    
+++++++++++
MAYBE
+++++++++++
- export list to anki
? change to a left side, rightside algorithm to fit, rather than sigmoid
- make 'more...' a framed popup to avoid leaving site/test
- show user other tests from same ip. links, graph
? better message for attempting to continue a timed out test? (rarely comes up)
? log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
? change colour scheme? Dark mode?
? merger of all testing thingies? Select a from and to (kanji->english, eng->eng) .... some losses from going generic, easier to maintain, harder to build... vocab only?
? switch to dictionary api? (free is normally 100s/hr which is like 1~2 users only lol)
    https://medium.com/@martin.breuss/finding-a-useful-dictionary-api-52084a01503d
? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
    - https://dictionaryapi.com/ allows 1k/day, wordnik.com allows 100/hr ... enough to rebuild DB, but not grab live (check permissions)
    - https://medium.com/@martin.breuss/finding-a-useful-dictionary-api-52084a01503d
    - use a 'learner's dictionary' for 5000 basic words
    - manually rewrite the easiest 100.
    - multiple languages/setting? (german, japanese definitions?) (E-J test ...)
    ? Use the wiktionary DB i ripped/made ........ but the '1st definition' system is questionable. If I switch, I'd need to allow multiple definitions
        - also need to re-rip since i bugged out antonyms somehow
? Add categories for top 25 'topics' from wiktionary data set, enable this in history somehow
