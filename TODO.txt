+ find more users! Reddit? DMs?
    
- look for english anki list for easy word defns

+++++++++++
MAIN
+++++++++++

+ collect a bit more test data: studymode? End time? (and add to history page)

Test Mode:
    ? new 'help' button images, reenable button
    - report definition button
        ? popup that allows user to reccomend a definition
            + puts the text into a log (word id + suggestion) i can check manually later
        ? simply adds the word to a list to check (no security risks, less space, easy)
    ? flip button on both sides?
    ? make flip optional?
    ? add a drop word button to study mode

Study Mode:
    ? settings for # of repeats, etc.
    ? Give an animation when one of them goes up
    ? Only add words to study if they are near or below current prediction (should know)
        
History:
    + Add a reading level estimate w/ links to recommended reading (or study material at lower levels), amazon widget?
    ? show user other tests from same ip. links, graph
    ? better catches for bad links
    ?? grey out continue button after it would be predicted to time out
    - 'wrong' list filter by tags
    - More flav text
         - more quotes
         - 'gob smacked'  flocculent hygrometry soliloquize dunner pavior trousseau brobdingnagian rantipole treacle

Admin:
    - bold active tests in adminpage
    ? make a flush redis button in admin
    ? add a full reset fn to admin page (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 0, force update)
    
Code Refactoring:
    - rebuffer tests when opened in history to redis - save lots of sql calls (only bother if needed) - could also just up the linger time in redis - needs a new timestamp for 'old' tests (on creation?)
    - switch from deprecated to_msgpack (use pyarrow?)
    ? kanji->question meaning->answer etc.
    ? trim the req list further
    ? shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')? (more readable)
    ? move scheduler times into config
    
Logic:
    ? for doing prediction, could pre-bin and avg the data (size50?) and make assumptions about empty bins (l/r of mid)
        - current issue is that empty sections get 0 weight resulting in flatter
        - doing this could weaken the granularity of the data
        - could add in binned data to normal data
        - adaptive bin size based on # of answers?
            - size = 10k/#q
            - so with 100 answers, we'd be adding 100 bins of size 100, this almost definitely improves results
        - is this worth doing when results are currently good enough?
        - would need to change the regularization all over again
    ? old bounds prediction was sort of better (took slope into account), maybe tune it to line up w/ new data?            
    ? question selection should change slope to be flatter?
        
DB:
    + add wikitags, toefl, grade level estimates, categories? (like 'medical','archaic')       
        - many-many relational table (<1 tag/word)
    - join data from wiki
        ? paste in defns over 'alt of'.... (everything under 15letter defns?)
        ? easy way to swap definitions to ones from wiki
        + need to keep under 5MB limit
    ? test_log should ideally store num_known/pred[0] as well instead of just using 'a' which isn't quite accurate for comparisons
    - collect age, native speaker data

PR:
    - basic seo
    ? medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github. Or add an about section?
                 
Bugs:
    ? words at extremes aren't reshuffling w/ l2r (like entest)
    ?? forcemetaupdate throwing a timeout with no error msgs... randomly twice, then it worked fine. (was cpu sleeping?)
    + vertbars vanish on mouseover
    - "103 questions answered! Less than the average 103 of other testers."
	
CONTINUOUS:
    * review git log to find changes to push across
    * update FP notices, tweak config, push through L2r changes if needed
    * tweets, msg some teaching sites to see if they're interested, hit up dms
    * get rid of magic numbers, switch to config variables, clean CSS, redo comments
    
+++++++++++
LATER
+++++++++++

+ config: reduce step size for l2r, set test timeout back to 1hr
- ask around about ad hosts (after i have a userbase big enough)

+++++++++++
MAYBE
+++++++++++
? change to a left side, rightside algorithm to fit, rather than sigmoid
? log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
? change colour scheme? Dark mode?
? merger of all testing thingies? Select a from and to (kanji->english, eng->eng) .... some losses from going generic, easier to maintain, harder to build... vocab only?
? Add categories for top 25 'topics' from wiktionary data set, enable this in history somehow
? reexamine the range prediction based on more data (rerun the last analysis)
