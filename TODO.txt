Tweaking:
    - recalculate values for L2R config
    - rework the formulae around starting/default-t .... tends to be way too steep, need to quarter the assumed steepness (the min t vals seem fine though)
        - better still, use fewer magic numbers here....
    - recalculate the 'pct_known_by_appearance' by adding up all the known values (costly?)
    - fix the words multiplier (10k .... 5x?)
    
DB:
    ? change the dictionary for simpler words to cut down on complexity
        - use 2~3 dictionaries as needed
        - show multiple or just one
        - multiple languages/setting?
        - can i pull definitions and not store them myself? (could allow many more definitions)
    - need to handle logging questions better
        - currently could overrun the 10k limit and crash server...
        - why ever log more than 500?
        - drop id?
        - log blocks of questions in test and drop this table entirely? (incorrect way to do it, but handles the 10k cap better)
        
Front end:
    - Add alpha test warning, talk about word ordering 'logo' vs 'churl'
	- new 'help' button images
	- check all social media links

	- enable the keep alive
    
CORE/BOTH:
    - enable autopushing l2r w/ the meta updates
    - update packages/python
    - identify magic numbers w/ inline comments
    - flesh out admin page
        - add a shutdown fn (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 1, force update)
        - flush/reset redis
    
Fork (Keep jiken in mind EVERY git commit):
