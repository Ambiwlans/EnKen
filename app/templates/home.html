		<br>
		<p>EnTest is an English vocabulary test, but instead of blindly quizzing you on a ton of random words, it uses machine learning 
		to ask you only the words most relevant to you. After only 10 questions, it will estimate how many you know. 
		Keep answering to make the estimate more and more accurate! (Not just for yourself, the system learns from your answers to make more accurate estimates in the future.</p>
		<p>When you are done, the test results will make a study list of words you missed. You can also 
		bookmark your results to see how you improve as you study English. Or share your results and challenge friends.</p>
        
        <container><p><mark><b>NOTICE:</b> This site is in alpha and very buggy still. The current word ranking is based on frequency of appearance in books which tend to be older, leaving 'churl' as a more common/'easy' word than 'avatar'. The more tests people take, the more accurate the rankings become! Thank you for the help!</mark></p></container>
